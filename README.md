# weather-app
A simple weather app that uses tkinter and the OpenWeatherMaps API to display an application which gathers an input for the city name and shows current weather conditions. Remember to visit https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up to create an account. Once your account is created, you will need to generate a FREE API key which you can paste into the code.
